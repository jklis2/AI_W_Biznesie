    title: 'How to Choose the Right CPU for Your Needs?',
    content: `Choosing the right processor depends on your use case. For gaming, high clock speeds and multi-core architecture are essential—Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 are good choices. For content creation or rendering, go for CPUs with more cores, like Ryzen 9 or Intel Core i9. Also, ensure compatibility with your motherboard and check the TDP to select proper cooling.`,

    title: 'Which Graphics Card is Best for Gaming and Work?',
    content: `For gaming, GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon RX cards offer great performance. Models like RTX 4060/4070 or RX 7700 XT work well for 1440p, while RTX 4080 or RTX 4090 are ideal for 4K. For professionals, VRAM is crucial—video editing and 3D rendering require GPUs with at least 12GB of VRAM.`,

    title: 'SSD vs. HDD – Which One Should You Choose?',
    content: `If speed is your priority, go for an NVMe SSD—they are significantly faster than standard HDDs and SATA SSDs. HDDs are still useful for storing large files, such as games, movies, or backups. The best setup is using an SSD for the OS and frequently used programs, with an HDD for long-term storage.`,

    id: 5,
    title: 'How Much RAM Do You Need for Gaming and Work?',
    content: `16GB of RAM is the minimum for smooth performance. Gamers and streamers should go for 32GB, while professionals working with video editing or 3D modeling may need 64GB or more. Consider RAM speed—DDR5 offers higher bandwidth, but DDR4 is still a cost-effective choice.`,
  },

    id: 6,
    title: 'How to Choose the Right Power Supply?',
    content: `Your PSU should provide enough power for your components—650-850W is enough for most gaming PCs, while high-end builds may need 1000W or more. Look for 80 PLUS certification (Gold, Platinum) for efficiency. Avoid cheap, uncertified power supplies as they can damage components.`,

    title: 'How to Assemble a PC Step by Step?',
    content: `1. Install the CPU and cooler on the motherboard.  
  2. Insert RAM sticks into the correct slots.  
  3. Place the motherboard in the case and secure it.  
  4. Install the GPU and any expansion cards.  
  5. Connect SSDs/HDDs to the motherboard.  
  6. Plug in power cables and front panel connectors.  
  7. Double-check connections and boot up the PC.`,
